This is a simple RISC-V Disassembler implemented in the C programming language.

Description The RISC-V Disassembler is designed to take RISC-V machine code instructions and convert them into human-readable assembly language instructions. It parses the binary machine code and produces the corresponding assembly language representation. This program was part of a course, CMPT 295 at Simon Fraser University. Various files in binary format have been included to test the program.

Features Disassembly: Converts RISC-V machine code to assembly language instructions. User-Friendly: Provides a human-readable output for a better understanding of machine code.
